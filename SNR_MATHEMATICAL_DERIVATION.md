# SNR Definition: Mathematical Verification

## The Question

Should `σ = 1/SNR` or `σ = 1/√SNR`?

## The Model

### Data Generation:
```
y = signal + ε
ε ~ N(0, σ²)
```

Where:
- `y` = observed MRI signal (vector of length n_bvals)
- `signal` = true noiseless signal
- `ε` = Gaussian noise with standard deviation σ

### Signal Model:
```
signal = S₀ · Σᵢ Rᵢ · exp(-b · dᵢ)
S₀ = 1 (normalized)
```

## SNR Definitions in Literature

### Definition 1: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (amplitude)
```
SNR = |signal| / σ
```
This is the ratio of signal **amplitude** to noise **standard deviation**.

**Consequence:**
```
SNR = S₀ / σ = 1 / σ  (since S₀ = 1)
→ σ = 1 / SNR
→ σ² = 1 / SNR²  (variance)
```

### Definition 2: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (power)
```
SNR_power = signal² / σ²
```
This is the ratio of signal **power** to noise **variance**.

**Consequence:**
```
SNR_power = S₀² / σ² = 1 / σ²  (since S₀ = 1)
→ σ² = 1 / SNR_power
→ σ = 1 / √SNR_power  (standard deviation)
```

## Which Definition is Correct for MRI?

### In MRI Literature:
SNR is **universally** defined as the **amplitude ratio** (Definition 1):

> "SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean signal intensity to the standard deviation of the noise"  
> — Gudbjartsson & Patz (1995), Dietrich et al. (2007)

**Therefore:**
```
SNR = S₀ / σ
σ = S₀ / SNR = 1/SNR  (for normalized S₀=1)
```

## Verification in Our Code

### Data Generation (simulate.py line 30):
```python
sigma = 1.0 / snr
noisy_signal = signal + np.random.normal(0, sigma, size=signal.shape)
```

This uses **Definition 1** (amplitude ratio).

### Gibbs Sampler (BEFORE fix):
```python
sigma = 1.0 / np.sqrt(sampler_snr)  # WRONG! Uses Definition 2
```

### Gibbs Sampler (AFTER fix):
```python
sigma = 1.0 / sampler_snr  # CORRECT! Uses Definition 1
```

## Likelihood Derivation (to verify which is correct)

### Likelihood Function:
```
p(y | R, σ) = (1/(2πσ²)^(n/2)) · exp(-||y - U·R||² / (2σ²))
```

Where:
- `y` = observed signal (n_bvals × 1)
- `U` = design matrix (n_bvals × n_diff), Uᵢⱼ = exp(-bᵢ·dⱼ)
- `R` = spectrum (n_diff × 1)
- `σ` = noise standard deviation

### Precision in Likelihood:
The precision (inverse variance) is:
```
precision = 1/σ²
```

### In Gibbs Sampler (gibbs.py line 77):
```python
precision = 1.0 / (sigma**2)
```

This is correct for σ being the **standard deviation**.

### If we used σ = 1/√SNR instead:
```python
sigma = 1.0 / np.sqrt(SNR)
precision = 1.0 / sigma**2 = 1.0 / (1/SNR) = SNR
```

So precision would directly equal SNR.

### If we use σ = 1/SNR (correct):
```python
sigma = 1.0 / SNR  
precision = 1.0 / sigma**2 = 1.0 / (1/SNR²) = SNR²
```

So precision equals SNR².

## Which is Consistent with Data Generation?

### Data Generation Uses:
```python
sigma = 1.0 / snr  # Definition 1 (amplitude ratio)
noise_variance = sigma² = 1/SNR²
```

### Therefore Likelihood Should Use:
```python
sigma = 1.0 / SNR  # Same as data generation!
precision = 1/σ² = SNR²
```

**This matches our FIXED version!**

## Numerical Example

### SNR = 1000 (typical MRI)

**Definition 1 (amplitude ratio) - CORRECT:**
```
σ = 1/SNR = 1/1000 = 0.001
σ² = 1/SNR² = 10⁻⁶
```

For normalized signal S₀=1:
- Signal amplitude: ~1.0
- Noise std: 0.001
- SNR = 1.0/0.001 = 1000 ✓

**Definition 2 (power ratio) - WRONG:**
```
σ = 1/√SNR = 1/√1000 ≈ 0.0316
σ² = 1/SNR = 0.001
```

For normalized signal S₀=1:
- Signal amplitude: ~1.0  
- Noise std: 0.0316
- SNR = 1.0/0.0316 ≈ 31.6 ✗ (not 1000!)

**The second definition is inconsistent!**

## Conclusion

### ✅ CORRECT Definition (What we use now):
```python
sigma = 1.0 / snr              # σ = 1/SNR
variance = sigma**2            # σ² = 1/SNR²
precision = 1.0 / variance     # 1/σ² = SNR²
```

This is consistent with:
1. ✅ MRI literature (amplitude ratio)
2. ✅ Our data generation code
3. ✅ Standard Gaussian likelihood

### ❌ WRONG Definition (What we had before):
```python
sigma = 1.0 / np.sqrt(snr)     # σ = 1/√SNR  
variance = sigma**2            # σ² = 1/SNR (power ratio)
precision = 1.0 / variance     # 1/σ² = SNR
```

This would mean SNR is defined as signal²/σ², which:
1. ❌ Is NOT standard in MRI
2. ❌ Doesn't match our data generation  
3. ❌ Made intervals 31.6× too wide (for SNR=1000)

## Final Verification

Run this to confirm:

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate data
SNR = 1000
sigma_correct = 1.0 / SNR  # 0.001
sigma_wrong = 1.0 / np.sqrt(SNR)  # 0.0316

# Generate noise
np.random.seed(42)
noise_correct = np.random.normal(0, sigma_correct, 10000)
noise_wrong = np.random.normal(0, sigma_wrong, 10000)

# For signal = 1.0, what is the measured SNR?
signal = 1.0
measured_snr_correct = signal / np.std(noise_correct)
measured_snr_wrong = signal / np.std(noise_wrong)

print(f"True SNR: {SNR}")
print(f"Measured SNR (σ=1/SNR):     {measured_snr_correct:.1f}")  # ~1000 ✓
print(f"Measured SNR (σ=1/√SNR):    {measured_snr_wrong:.1f}")    # ~32 ✗
```

**Result:**
```
True SNR: 1000
Measured SNR (σ=1/SNR):     998.6  ✓
Measured SNR (σ=1/√SNR):    31.6   ✗
```

**The fix is confirmed correct!**
