# Cursor Rules for spectra-estimation-dMRI Project

## Package Management
- ALWAYS use `uv` as the package manager for all Python-related commands
- Use `uv run python` instead of `python` for executing Python scripts
- Use `uv add` instead of `pip install` for adding dependencies
- Use `uv sync` for installing dependencies from lock file
- This prevents "python command not found" errors and ensures consistent environment management

## File Creation Policy
- DO NOT create new files unless explicitly requested by the user
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- When making changes, modify existing files in the codebase rather than creating new ones
- Only create new files when the user specifically asks for them

## Documentation Files
- DO NOT create documentation files (.md, .txt, README files, etc.) unless explicitly requested
- Do not generate documentation files proactively
- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks for it

## General Principles
- Prioritize simplicity by working with existing codebase structure
- Edit existing files to implement changes rather than creating new ones
- Use the existing project structure and patterns
- Follow the established code organization in the project

## Terminal Commands
- Always prefix Python commands with `uv run`
- Use `uv` for all package management operations
- Example: `uv run python script.py` instead of `python script.py`
- Example: `uv add package-name` instead of `pip install package-name`
